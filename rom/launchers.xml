The game heroes are charged with destroying the hoards of repulsive aliens who are invading the Earth. Many of the aliens are disguised as a variety of everyday street objects; such as telephone booths, oil cans, trash cans and mailboxes. The aliens reveal their true forms as the warriors approach. Each of the 3 heroes carries their own individual weapon; Gordon has his plasma gun, Karla has a flamethrower and Scooter has an electric whip. At the end of each level, the warriors will enter a building and the shoot-em-up action will switch to a first-person perspective.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Asterix is a 1- or 2-player horizontal-scrolling beat'em up based on the French comic series, 'Asterix &amp; Obelix'. The player fights as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the 'might' of the oppressive Roman Empire. Asterix includes a variety of humorous fighting moves, which are demonstrated in the game's attract mode. The artwork and feel of Asterix remains true to its French source material, and the game's many humorous touches (such as the way defeated Legionnaires crawl away) will be instantly familiar to fans of the comic-book and cartoon series. Bonus levels - such as the chariot race that awaits at the end of the first level - introduce different game-play elements to provide a break from the fighting.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A followup game to Cotton 2, Cotton Boomerang uses the same graphics, sound and enemies, but slightly different gameplay. Gone are the lifebars, now you have one-hit kills (similar to the very first episode). Gone are the extra lives, instead you have 3 chosen characters, tag-team style. Gone is the experience-based level system, leveling up now depends on bonus items during the game. Gone are the special, full-screen Magic attacks, instead you have an instant smart-bomb when you change into a different character in-game. Gone are the powerup-dependant magic attacks, now each character has his/her own magic attack by default. The characters are also equipped with secondary attacks to make their shooting style more distinctive from each other. And to top that, you have plenty of new moves, counterattacks, powerups, and key combinations to use. Whereas Cotton 2 was more of a tactical shooter (whenever that is applicable to the game) with its chain combo and life/experience system, Cotton Boomerang is an all-out shooter due to the added moves, different level layout, and generally faster and crazier gameplay.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that was unique at the time for featuring a game screen that was three times wider than the conventional size, with the arcade cabinet utilizing three CRT screens to accommodate it. In the game, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons : Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. During the course of the levels the player must navigate the terrain and battle a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles. At the end of every level, players are greeted with the obligatory end-of-level boss. The bosses in Darius are often in the form of mechanical aquatic animals, such as fish or squid. If the player defeats the boss, the tunnel splits into two and the player must decide whether to take the upper or lower tunnel, both of which lead to a different stage. This allows many different paths to be taken through the game. Power-ups can be obtained by shooting enemies of a certain color, with the power-ups appearing in the form of colored bubbles. Each color corresponds to one of the ship's three weapons :</gameplot>

				<gameplot>In the game, the third in the "Darius" series; the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons : Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. Some enemies leave panels behind that can be collected to power-up your shots, missiles or shield. The graphics and sound are superior to those of the previous Darius games, and the game employs a lot of impressive visual effects; for example, the Silver Hawk warps into a stage dramatically in the fourth-tier stages, and begins to burn on re-entry at the start of the sixth-tier stages. The bosses are huge and far more complex than those of the previous games, each employing several attack patterns and explode with powerful warping and twisting effects upon their defeat.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is littered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player. In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave. Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>An excellent vertically scrolling shoot'em up. The player assumes the role of a pilot who is sent by their squadron to fight their former allies until one side destroys the other, all of which is a part of a mission to strengthen the military power that controls each side. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire : by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed. The player can choose one of 3 aircraft at the start of the game, or upon continuing : Type A : A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots Type B : A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement Type C : A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A superb and innovative side-scrolling shoot-em-up from the same gaming stable that gave the world "R-Type", Irem. Dragon Breed differs from other shoot-em-ups through its interpretation of the 'ship' that appears in other games of the genre; in Dragon Breed, the player controls a figure who rides a fully articulated and superbly rendered dragon. What makes this a particularly inspired move is that the Dragon's body - which is invulnerable to enemies and enemy fire - can be used as both a shield and a weapon; the player can move the dragon in such a way that its tail can be used to surround its rider and protect him from his enemies. Any contact the enemy has with the dragon will also deplete the enemy's power and eventually kill it. The dragon can also be 'powered-up' in a similar fashion to the space craft of other shoot-em-ups. At various point throughout a level, small areas of land will appear at the bottom of the screen. These often contain power-ups and the player can fly the dragon down to the platform, dismount, and move around on foot.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter. 1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. After the benchmark-setting "Double Dragon", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Galaga '88 is an updated version of the old favorite, "Galaga", with more invaders and more player firepower. Galaga '88 gives players a chance to once again repel the invaders from the Galagan Kingdom. One or two players can try their hand at fighting the invaders. This time the Galagans have four more allies, each with unique weapons and defenses that a player must overcome. By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, they can warp to another dimension to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenging Stages (labelled in this game as 'That's Galactic Dancin'), the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune. The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last. Unique Features :</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it's destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values (dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting). Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in 1 row of 4), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in 2 rows of 8, directly below the Boss Galaga) and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in 2 rows of 10, directly below the Butterflies). In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in all proceeding stages. From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green "Spy Ships" from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of 8 Galagans is destroyed, bonus points (of between 1000 and 3000, depending on the stage) are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10000 points. Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : 1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. 2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.</gameplot>

Fight to save the humanity! Giga Wing is a shoot-em-up set during a fictional war.

				<gameplot>Golden Axe is a classic sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which between one and three warriors take up arms to save the King from the evil Death Adder, who wields the titular Golden Axe. The three different player characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a barbarian hero called Ax Battler, and a viking dwarf by the name of Gilius Thunderhead. Each hero uses a different kind of magic : Ax Battler uses earth magic, Tyris uses fire magic, and Gilius uses lightning magic. In addition : each player character also carries a different weapon : Tyris and Ax Battler both use swords while Gilius uses a battle axe smaller in size than the titular Golden Axe, which Death Adder uses. Each character in the game has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures (such as dragons) which, once their original riders have been knocked from the saddle, can be mounted and used against the enemy. At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, thieves appear carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit a thief causing him to drop either a magic potion or food. Once the game has been beaten, the ending will show a view of an arcade where the characters 'jump out' of the game, run out of the arcade and down the street.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior). As with 'Golden Axe', as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy. At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles. Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, 'Revenge' offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The player takes on the role of action movie hero, Indiana Jones, in a game that takes place over 3 different zones; the mines, a minecart chase and the temple. The first level features a number of platforms, ladders and slides and Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open. The player must also keep an eye out for rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards. The second zone is a recreation of the infamous minecart chase in the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine; keeping ahead of enemy carts and voiding traps and track-side enemies. The final area takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards and also flaming hearts thrown by the game's enemy boss, Mola Ram. The player can choose to start the game on any one of 3 difficulty levels : easy, medium and hard. These are selected at the beginning of the game by entering the corresponding door. Once all 3 Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and minecart section, before making his escape on the rope bridge and facing Mola Ram once and for all. Playing the easy level will not include this level the first time Indy acquires all three stones. Instead, a message will appear stating that Indy escaped on the rope bridge. The player is then returned to the game, starting again on a more difficult mines level.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Have you ever pictured a Mega Man game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That's pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Megaman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. You have to fight a total of 18 Robot Masters, taken from the first 7 Megaman games from the Nintendo Famicom. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Based on the movie of the same name, Moonwalker is a scrolling, isometric beat' em up in which Michael Jackson (1958-2009), along with his chimp Bubbles, attempts to save children and defeat the evil 'Mr. Big'. During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next. Each player's Michael Jackson character looks identical but wears a different colour : white (left player), red (middle player), and black (right player).</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss. As with Capcom's "Final Fight", and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the 'special attack' move. This works in a similar way to Sega's "Shinobi", with every enemy on the screen taking a hit. Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game's enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier's signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.</gameplot>

				<genre>Maze</genre>
				<release>1980</release>
				<publisher>Namco</publisher>
				<gameplot>Puckman is the original Japanese version of "Pac-Man", the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Pac-Man around a single-screen maze eating dots. Pac-Man is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Pac-Man losing a life. When all of Pac-Man's lives are lost, the game is over. (The ghosts' names differ between the Japanese and U.S. versions of the game. See the 'Updates' section below for complete details on name/nickname combinations.) Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Pac-Man. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Pac-Man eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Pac-Man. Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Pac-Man can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Pac-Man can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Pac-Man, making escape a little easier. Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Pac-Man and the ghosts in funny situations. 3 intermissions are present: 1) Blinky, the red ghost, chases Pac-Man across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Pac-Man! This intermission is played after Round 2. 2) Blinky is again chasing Pac-Man, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. 3) Blinky chases Pac-Man across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then Blinky reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Round 9, 13 and 17. No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>An incredibly addictive and original puzzle game in which players must form chains of four or more beans (known as 'Puyos') of the same colour to make to disappear. Players can hinder their opponent by forming Puyo combinations; a successfully formed chain removes some some of the player's Puyos and causes 'junk' Puyos to fall into the opponent's play area. As these Junk Puyos are transparent, they cannot be used to form a chain and can only be destroyed when a nearby chain is created.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>R-Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them. The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R-Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack. The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R-Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage. R-Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up. The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel. The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. R-Type II features three new weapon shot types:</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The third and final arcade release of this classic series (which would foster three further console-only sequels, see 'Series' for details) sees the Bydo Empire waging a full scale assault against other planets. R-Type Leo possesses many of the elements that made the first two games in the series such classics, but the feel and gameplay is very different. Both the beam laser and the pod make a return, but play a different role in this game. The pod in particular now acts more like a mini 'smart bomb', in that it only detaches from the player's ship for a few seconds, and automatically homes in on enemies. The level design is also far more open than that of its predecessors, and far more forgiving. R-Type Leo is a game that firmly divides opinions of fans of the series. Some considered it to be a blasphemy to the R-Type name, arguing that in making a game far more 'traditional', both in feel and level design, R-type Leo actually represented a step backwards from what the innovative original achieved. Less patient players undoubtedly prefer Leo's open levels and forgiving gameplay. Something that all can agree on, however, is how stunningly beautiful the game is. The detail and use of colour on both the backgrounds and enemy ships is incredible and is one of the finest examples of two-dimensional artwork the arcade has ever seen.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A direct sequel to 1988's "Shinobi", Shadow Dancer stars a young Ninja who, together with his faithful canine companion, must battle against a terrorist group. The terrorist group have planted a number of time bombs throughout the metropolis. The Ninja and his dog must set out to gather up all the explosives placed by the evil gang and to annihilate the criminal mastermind behind the Asian Dawn. Game-play is very similar to that of the original Shinobi, and features the jumping and projectile weapon-based game-play of its illustrious older brother. However, a new and crucial attacking move has since been added to the Ninja's arsenal. Pulling DOWN on the joystick and pressing the ATTACK button sends the hero's dog to attack the nearest enemy. This will stop the enemy from attacking the player as he wrestles with the dog. The enemy must be killed quickly, however, or the dog itself will be killed. If the dog is attacked, he will turn into a small puppy, and once the player has killed a set number of enemies, the puppy will grow to be a full-sized dog who can once again be used to attack enemies.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The Champion Edition was the first official sequel to "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior". New gameplay additions included the ability to play as any of the four boss characters (increasing the playable roster to twelve) and the option for both players to use the same characters in two-player fights - with an alternate color scheme introduced to distinguish them from each other. Some minor gameplay revisions were also made to balance the characters out. Additionally, while in the original SFII, one-player games could last up to ten rounds in the event of there being no clear winner (at which point the game made the player lose by default), in the Champion Edition this was reduced to just four rounds.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Street Fighter II - The World Warrior is the legendary fighting game that defined the fighting game genre. One or two players can choose from eight selectable World Warriors and must defeat the other seven, before finally taking on four non-selectable 'boss' characters. Each fighter is as distinctive in feel and fighting style as they are in physical appearance, with each protagonist possessing several fantastical 'special moves' (the first genuine example of such in the fighting genre) to accompany the usual array of kicks, punches and throws. These special moves, while being difficult to execute due to the complexity of the joystick and buttons combinations required, allows the fighter to inflict huge amounts of damage on their opponent. Street Fighter II is a fighting game in the truest sense of the word, with deceptively deep and strategic gameplay ensuring that experienced players would destroy simple 'button mashers' with relative ease.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Sunset Riders is a superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for one to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose. Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earthtake". During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are 2 bars and 3 sub-bars in the interface. The 2 main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to 9 levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it. The 3 sub-bars show the level of three of each player's special moves. Each character has at least three special moves, as shown in the sub-bars, and each of these corresponds to a colour. Some characters have one or 2 additional Special Moves that aren't affected by sub-bars. Each time a player shoots their opponent, gems pop out of him or her, and the attacker can take them to power up their own special moves according to the colours. There are 4 buttons : PUNCH, KICK, SPECIAL, and TAUNT. The Special button is a chargeable move that cannot be blocked and upon impact drops gems in the opponent's possession. More gems will be dropped depending on how much the player charges the attack. Holding Down, Forward or no direction at all when using the Special button will cause a specific gem color to drop from the enemy. Holding Back along with the Special button allows for a defense that is specific against the unblockable Special attacks. Other kinds of attacks do no damage when blocked, and unlike most 2-D fighting games, this includes special and super moves. Super Gem Fighter also features Flash Combos in which a player can execute a combo by pressing the KICK or PUNCH button after they have hit their opponent using the PUNCH button for a total of 4 hits. Flash Combos will usually cause a player's fighter (except Ryu) to change into various costumes during the sequence, and perform a powerful attack in the end. This final hit is usually the hardest in the sequence to connect with. These costumes range from uniforms (such as traffic cops or schoolgirls), to swimsuits, and even cameos of other Capcom characters. For example, Chun-Li may turn into Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series, while Felicia may turn into Mega Man or other Darkstalkers characters not playable in the game. The commands are also very easy compared to the Street Fighter series, thanks to SPECIAL button. By doing a motion (for example : qcf or hcf) and pressing the Special Button the fighter will launch his or her super combo. In addition to the usual punches, kicks and fireballs, each character has a couple of very abstract yet powerful 'special' attacks; which can range from the player producing a huge mallet (Ken), to standing on a podium and motioning a bicycle race through the opposing fighter (Chun Li).</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either 'Leonardo' (blue, katana blades), 'Raphael' (red, sais), 'Michaelangelo' (orange, nunchakas) or 'Donatello' (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to try and rescue 'April O'Neil' and 'Splinter', before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies 'Krang' and 'The Shredder'. Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for 'Jump' and 'Attack' - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a 'buy-in' option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Gameplay remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter. Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Two years after winning the original 'King of the Iron Fist' tournament, Kazuya Mishima decides to hold a second tournament in an attempt to finish off his father, Heihachi Mishima, in this sequel to 1994 original. The gameplay in Tekken 2 is identical to that of its predecessor, with one or two players fighting over a series of 3D-rendered backdrops. As before, the fighting system utilises four attack buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Certain button combinations will initiate both standard and special grab and throwing moves.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The Punisher is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, in which one or two players take on the role of either 'The Punisher' or 'Nick Fury' and must battle through six dangerous locales filled with violent criminal gangs, leading to a final confrontation with criminal mastermind, 'The Kingpin'. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding food that lies hidden in some of the background objects that litter the levels. Many enemies carry weapons, such as axes, baseball bats, swords and knives and should players manage to knock these from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick up the weapons and use them against the enemies. In keeping with their comic book counterparts, each player character also carries a handgun; this only comes into play when confronted with gun-wielding enemies, at which point the players' guns are drawn automatically. Once the gun-carrying enemies have been killed, the players' guns are automatically re-holstered. A large and powerful gang boss awaits the heroes at the end of each stage. The five gang bosses are Scully, Guardroid, Bonebreaker, Bushwacker and Guardroid 2. The sixth and final level takes place in The Kingpin's lair, ending with a showdown with the criminal mastermind himself.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic action-adventure game where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons &amp; Co.) to get treasures. The game has 3 difficulty settings:Level 1 (Easiest)Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add difficulty.Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the Kingdom.Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.</gameplot>

The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved — the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).</gameplot>

Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</gameplot>

The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave.

				<gameplot>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The objective of Dig Dug is to eliminate underground-dwelling monsters. This can be done by inflating them until they pop or by dropping rocks on them. There are two kinds of enemies in the game: Pookas, round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles, and Fygars, green dragons who can breathe fire. The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The king's treasures have been stolen! As the daring young prince, your goal is to recover them all. The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Enduro is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</gameplot>

Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</gameplot>

Along the way, he must negotiate numerous hazards, including pits, quicksand, rolling logs, fire, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and crocodiles. Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on a vine to avoid them. Treasure includes gold and silver bars, diamond rings, and bags of money. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various places. This is required to get around some surface areas that have no way across otherwise. The tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again. The tunnels also contain treasure and scorpions Harry must jump over.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</gameplot>

				<gameplot>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges. </gameplot>

				<gameplot>Your divers are out in the ocean collecting treasure; now that they have found what they're looking for, you need to pilot a submarine and return them safely to the surface! You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level. Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Space Invaders is a game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>n Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</gameplot>

And it never did in any legal form.  But enterprising Asian game pirates saw an opportunity to cash in on Sega and Disney in one go, and thus this wholly unlicensed conversion of the GameBoy Color version of A Bug's Life appeared on the Genesis:</gameplot>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</gameplot>

This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:•Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.•Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.•Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.•The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</gameplot>

This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon.

				<gameplot>After her defeat by the Galactic Corporation at the battle of Canis Major, the evil Dark Queen and her renegade space troops retreat to the outer reaches of the universe, hiding out in dark spaces between the stars. Meanwhile, on board the spaceship Vulture, Professor T. Bird and the trio of Battletoads - Rash, Zitz and Pimple - are escorting the Princess Angelica back to her home planet, where her father, the Terran Emperor, awaits her safe arrival. Along the way, Pimple, the biggest Battletoad, takes Angelica out for a cruise in the Toadster to a nearby Leisure Station, but the Dark Queen ambushes them before they can get there, and they are kidnapped and carried away to Ragnarok's World, the Dark Queen's planet. Professor Bird sends remaining Battletoads down on Ragnarok to save Pimple and Angelica, but it will be a hard battle against planet's dangerous environments, traps and Dark Queen's troops. They have to go a long way from the planet's rough surface to deep caves and landed Gargantua and ultimately to the Tower of Shadows, where the Dark Queen awaits.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area, as in Tetris. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns".While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.Like Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</gameplot>

But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</gameplot>

While the basic concept remains the same, the game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree as well as completely new levels.As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The storyline involves many colorful characters. Jim (voiced by TenNapel) was at first an ordinary earthworm who did very earthworm-like things such as flee from crows and eat dirt. One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an "Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit" built by Professor Monkey-for-a-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim. By a stroke of luck, Jim managed to land within the collar of the suit, and it ended up mutating him into the large and intelligent (at least by earthworm standards) superhero he is today.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. The character of Death Adder and the stolen Golden Axe could well be traced to the historical event of the Acquisition of the True Cross during the Sassanid-Byzantine wars, as the Norse mythology is heavily influenced by Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies.The player controls one of three Warriors. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>In Mortal Kombat, the player receives information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another mainly in biographies that are displayed when the start button is not pressed, during attract mode in the title screen. These bios featured short videos of the characters taking their fighting stances and text informing the motives for each character to enter the tournament. The game takes place in a fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring on the fictional realms of the Mortal Kombat series. The original game is notably the only title in the series that features only one realm, that being Earthrealm. The tournament featured in the story actually takes place fully at Shang Tsung's Island, located somewhere on Earth, with seven of its locations serving as Kombat Zones.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Following his failure to defeat to Liu Kang in the first Mortal Kombat game, the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung begs his master, Shao Kahn, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.</gameplot>

After all five tracks were won, the player would advance to the next level, where the track would be longer, the opponents faster, and much more money at stake for a victory or a loss.</gameplot>

Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.At Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.At Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere.

After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.If all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal.

The player finishes each level, generally moving from left to right, within a time limit of 10 minutes.  Along the way, rings are collected and Badniks are defeated. Star posts serve as checkpoints, where if the player was to lose a life then he or she would return to one.  When the player has collected at least 50 rings, star posts can be run past for an optional Special Stage.  At the end of the last act of each zone (with the exception of Sky Chase Zone which does not have a boss), Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles is a game that results when Sonic 3 is locked-on to Sonic &amp; Knuckles via Lock-On Technology. It acts as one large combined game and all the levels from Sonic 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles become available. There are several noticeable differences when playing the games combined. Knuckles is playable in the Sonic 3 levels and Tails becomes available in the Sonic &amp; Knuckles levels. Also, all of the levels from both games are accessible, starting from Sonic 3. Once these levels are completed the Death Egg falls off screen intact instead of being destroyed, and then the play continues straight to the levels of Sonic &amp; Knuckles. The final boss of Sonic 3 is also omitted for Sonic and Tails.After collecting all the Chaos Emeralds of Sonic 3 a new quest becomes available when entering the first special Stage in Mushroom Hill Zone which allows you to collect seven new Emeralds called "Super Emeralds". When these Emeralds are collected, Hidden Palace Zone will become available, and Sonic can transform into Hyper Sonic and Knuckles can transform into Hyper Knuckles. Tails has no Hyper form, but the Super Emeralds are needed for him to transform into Super Tails, as the Chaos Emeralds alone have no effect on him.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Dr. Robotnik has assumed control of Mt. Mobius and turned it into a mechanical base. Utilizing energy produced by the magma flowing under the volcano, this new monstrosity (the Veg-O-Fortress) has the power to transform helpless animals into robot slaves at an astounding rate. Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails' airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it's built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable. Robotnik, however, is also aware of the fragile relationship that exists between the Emeralds and the mountain, and he's set up an elaborate Pinball Defense System to make sure the precious jewels don't go anywhere.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>In the first level, the player controls Spider-Man who must use his spider sense to disarm several bombs located throughout the immediate exterior and maze-like entrance to an abandoned building. After the player completes this level Spider-Man learns that the evil Arcade has kidnapped Storm, Cyclops, Wolverine, and Gambit. The player must successfully complete each character's level (each set in Arcade's deadly "Murderworld") in order to get to control Spider-Man in a final battle with Arcade.After completing each stage, the player controls each hero as they fight in similar-designed mini-levels themed after the "Behind-the-Scenes" of Murderworld. The only character to have a significant change is Storm, who now walks, shoots multiple bolts of lightning rapidly and calls upon gusts of wind, and jumps about four times the height of the other characters. The last level takes place inside a large room, where Arcade chases Spider-Man back and forth in a large Arcade-shaped robot, which operates like a Matryoshka Doll, until Arcade is finally defeated. The X-Men stand-by at the edges of the room, occasionally attacking on their own.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The Mega Drive/Genesis version, developed by Clockwork Tortoise and published by Sega, is a run 'n' gun where both Batman and Robin must stop Mr. Freeze, who plans to freeze Gotham City. In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.The game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shirukens in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.The game is regarded as being extremely difficult to complete, and also known for showcasing some of the most impressive special effects on the Mega Drive/Genesis. It also features a soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. This accounts for the relatively high quality of Kyd's compositions, as well as the fairly simple FM synthesized nature of the game's sound effects.</gameplot>

It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop Skull Master!This is a platform game in which you control Max himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't influence the gameplay). You travel through several different worlds. Your goal is to find Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around the level, and to destroy them. The levels are timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who will disturb you on your way to the goal. </gameplot>

				<gameplot>The game is a side-scrolling platform game, with the controlled character having to leap, climb, run and descend from platform to platform. There is an exception during the level The Stampede, where Simba is running towards (or in the NES and Game Boy versions, running with the camera looking straight down on top of him) the camera dodging wildebeest and leaping over rocks.In most versions of the game two bars appear on the HUD. To the left is the roar meter, which must be fully charged for Simba's roar to be effective. To the right is the health bar which decreases when Simba is hurt. At the bottom left of the screen is a counter showing how many lives Simba has remaining. Health can be restored by collecting bugs which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some rare health-damaging bugs also exist.The player controls Simba (first as a cub, then later as an adult) in the main levels and either Timon or Pumbaa in the bonus levels.</gameplot>

There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. While the game is in 3D, the game play resembles early 2D platformers in which you generically either go left or right, limiting the mobility of each character.</gameplot>

Buster must go through several levels, including a volcano, an undersea adventure, a pirate ship, and a forest, among many other levels. However, many of his foes are out to stop him, including Roderick Rat and Gene Splicer, who has brainwashed several of Buster's friends, including Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil and Hamton J Pig. Upon defeating Gene, the helmet used to control Buster's friends will fall off and explode, leaving them slightly confused about what has happened to them, or simply to fall down in a comical fashion, as in the case of Calamity Coyote.To complete each level, Buster must find Gogo Dodo, who will allow him to jump through a portal. Additionally, Buster can find portals reminiscent of the show's rainbow-coloured logo, that will take Buster into Wackyland. Here, Buster must attempt to collect as many items as he can before touching one of the numerous Dodos that populate the level.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Aero Fighters", players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge. The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game. Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game. One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active. Aero Fighters now features an array of 10 selectable pilots : American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm ('Pfeil' is german for 'Arrow') German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details) : The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. The Diabloon piloted by The Man. Planes Spec. : Vought F4U Corsair can have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs. Northrop P-61 Black Widow can have 3 power-ups and 7 bombs. Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs. Aichi M6A1 Seiran can have 2 power-ups and 5 bombs. Il-2 Stormovik can have 2 power-ups and 7 bombs. Polikarpov I-16 can have 4 power-ups and 6 bombs. Dornier Do-335 Pfeil can have 3 power-ups and 4 bombs. Junkers Ju-87 Stuka can have 4 power-ups and 7 bombs. Westland Whirlwind can have 3 power-ups and 6 bombs. Fairy Swordfish can have 1 power-up and 7 bombs. Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit, see below) can have 2 power-ups and 4 bombs. Diabloon (see below) can have 7 power-ups and 2 bombs.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters. The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as "Streets of Rage" or "Final Fight" because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the 'D' button, (Which many of SNK's other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A &amp; B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat 'em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special &amp; standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while. Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a 'Crazy Meter' at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the Gan Gan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US. Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Blue's Journey is an environmentally-themed side-scrolling platform game for one or two players. The player controls a heroic young man named 'Blue' (in the two-player game the second player controls 'Princess Fa', who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of 'Raguy' has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game's form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and help with overcoming certain obstacles, or health and weapon power-ups.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami's "Contra" series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world. Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels. At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The sequel of the first "Fighter's History", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance  the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's). The character rooster now sports 13 selectable characters, with the addition of two new entries. The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed. A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'. The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot. The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis. The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters. The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available. Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri. Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures. Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.</gameplot>

The world is now trembling under the fear of cyber terror, as the birth of a deadly new computer virus threatens to snatch the main military system out of every country.

				<gameplot>One or two players take control of 2 machine-gun carrying Vietnam vets who must shoot their way through a number of sideways scrolling, Vietnam-themed levels. the players shoot into the screen and aiming is achieved via the use an on-screen target, which each player directs to lock on to the various enemy troops and vehicles. Players can run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire. A number of more powerful weapons - such as grenades and flame throwers - are often dropped by the enemy and can be picked up and used. Bonus points are also revealed in this fashion. Nam-1975 is a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in September 1988. Cabal is easily the more accomplished of the two games.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom's most famous game characters. 'SVC Chaos' primarily utilizes the command system of the "King of Fighters" series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, "Capcom vs. SNK 2", SvC features no air guards and lacks a 'groove system', instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition. Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing 'Exceeds' (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the 'Zujou Sashi' used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army. Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted. Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Control a present-day fighter to take on militaries from across the globe in AeroFighters, a classic-style, 2D shooter viewed from the top-down perspective. Opponents come from the air (helicopters and bombers), land (gun stations, bases, and tanks), and sea (battleships, submarines, spaceship-like military trials and plenty of fighters).AeroFighters lets you choose from twelve planes, each with a distinctive character. Only four are available instantly, an F-18, FSX, AJ-37 and AU-8, while others have to be earned through completion or cheats (see game summary for cheats). Each character has a different mission base to suit their fighter, a huge range of power-ups and weapons, and a distinctive bomb feature for clearing the screen.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>They're zany to the max and make you laugh till you collapse. They're Animaniacs. Join Yakko, Wakko and Dot as they strive to put an end to Pinky &amp; the Brain's quest for global domination. The mice have managed to steal the hottest script in Hollywood, which, after it has made billions of dollars, will enable them to eventually take over the world. As the Warner brothers (and the Warner sister), it's your job to find the missing scenes of the script as you make your way through seven Warner Bros. movie sound stages, including "Adventure Kingdom," "Fantastic Fantasy Zone" and "Ocean of Doom." You control either Yakko, Wakko or Dot as the other two follow closely behind, even climbing on top of you if the situation calls for it. However, when one gets captured, you must rescue him (or her). Otherwise, your game is over after all three Warners have been caught. Along the way, other popular Animaniacs from the animated series will make cameos. These include such favorites as Dr. Scratchansniff, the Goodfeathers, Ralph the security guard and the Warner Brothers' favorite medical assistant, ("Hellooooo, Nurse!"). They're animaney -- totally insaney -- in a video gamey -- Animaniacs! (Those are the facts.)</gameplot>

Whether you decide to play as the Caped Crusader or the Boy Wonder, your job is to save Gotham City from the clutches of The Riddler and Two-Face (and the latter's sidekicks, Sugar and Spice).Throughout the game's eight levels of play, you must battle the aforementioned villains and their henchmen (such as killer clowns) using a variety of punch and kick moves and special bat gadgets, such as Batarangs, smoke pellets, tranquilizer darts, and grappling hooks. Some of the levels contain puzzles, such as hidden switches to pull and pieces of gadget blueprints to find.The normal game mode of Batman Forever roughly follows the plot of the film, taking place in such locations as the Second Bank of Gotham City, the circus, and an abandoned subway station. Your ultimate goal, in addition to saving your fair city, is to rescue the beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian from The Riddler. She is being held at Claw Island, The Riddler's nightmarish factory. Throughout the various levels you can find helpful items (such as Riddler boxes and Two-Face coins) for gaining lives, energy, time, and tips.A special training mode of play lets you, or you and a friend, hone your combat skills by pitting you (as hero or villain) against Batcomputer-generated characters in one-on-one (or two-on-two) fights.</gameplot>

Players can shoot missiles and bombs at other cars in order to upgrade their vehicles to compete against bosses and race on tougher courses. One particularly effective weapon can even stall enemy cars in their tracks. The audio/visuals in this game are merely competent, and the racing action is hampered by uneven (and somewhat frustrating) controls, depending on how the car has been upgraded.

Promising to grant their wishes, the separate clans of the Dragon Family started fighting amongst each other, hoping for the power the Goddess had to offer.One clan, the Light Dragons, realized that something was amiss and sent a warrior to stop the evils.

One day you take a nap near the remains of a once great dragon, only to wake and find that both your father and sister are missing. Upon being received as an orphan into a local church, you meet and befriend a little thief named Bow. Agreeing that greater things lie in the next village, the two of venture across the country and into a cave. You meet with a fierce monster and all goes black. Years pass like the wind and your childhood is all but a memory of the past. And thus your adventure begins...Breath of Fire II utilizes the same tried and true over-head perspective and graphics somewhat in the style of Final Fantasy III. The battle modes have differences here and there, but much of the key actions such as attack, magic, defense, item, or special move remain. The game also contains "party building" elements, instead of revolving around a lone, central hero as in the Zelda games. The game also contains multiple game save slots and the ability to name the main character.</gameplot>

Much of the blastathon action is of the standard side-scrolling platform variety, but two of the six levels incorporate a surprisingly effective overhead view. Giant bosses, constant shooting action, the ability to detonate bombs, intense gameplay, huge explosions, rich graphics, death-defying acrobatics, and spectacular Mode 7 effects make Contra III: The Alien Wars one of the best platform shooters available for any system. The game could benefit from a few more levels, and slowdown occurs from time to time, but these problems can easily be overlooked in a game as enjoyable as this.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Based on the 1992 animated film, Disney's Aladdin brings the magic of Walt Disney to your Super NES. If you'll recall from the film, Jafar, the Sultan's evil advisor, has spent years searching for Aladdin's Lamp, an artifact that holds the key to the greatest power in the world -- a genie who will grant the lamp's owner three wishes!Jafar finally locates the precious lamp in the Cave of Wonders and sends a worthless thief named Gazeem in after it. Unfortunately for Jafar, the cave, which has mouth like a tiger, rises in anger and rejects the unworthy Gazeem. The cave then decrees that "Only one who is worthy may enter. One whose rags hide a heart that is pure. A diamond in the rough..."This diamond in the rough is Aladdin, a boy who is tricked by Jafar into retrieving the lamp from the dangerous cave. Once Aladdin finds the lamp, he releases the power of a wacky blue genie.This game puts you in control of Aladdin, who has a pet monkey named Abu. It is your mission to outwit Jafar and spoil his nefarious plans. Also, you must rescue Jasmine, a beautiful princess, and win her love in the process.Disney's Aladdin begins in the Market Place where you'll run for your life from angry merchants and other enemies. Next you'll enter the Cave of Wonders and search for the magical lamp. Upon leaving the cave, you will take a magic carpet ride. After escaping from the cave, you must brave the dangers of three more levels: Inside the Genie's Lamp, The Pyramid, and Jafar's Palace. Like any good street urchin with a heart of gold, you as Aladdin are very agile and can run, duck, jump, swing (from beams), do somersaults, bounce and climb. You can throw apples (which you'll find scattered throughout the various levels) at or jump on the knife-throwers, snake charmers, dueling guards, animated skeletons and other enemies you'll run across. You'll also face numerous obstacles such as fiery lava, clay pots and arrows.To help you in your mission, you can collect enchanted items. These include bread and roasted chicken, which refill your health meter, and hearts, which add an extra heart to your health meter. Scooping up 100 emeralds or a magic lamp will grant you an extra chance to complete the adventure. Also, you can collect treasure and tip over jars to see what's hidden inside.After you complete a level in Disney's Aladdin, the genie will reward you with a magical password that will save your progress after you turn off your game system. The game features animation modeled after the film and two hit Disney songs: "Whole New World" and "Friend Like Me."</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong are off to find the missing Donkey and Diddy, who disappeared while celebrating their victory over King K. Rool. Donkey Kong Country 3 plays very much like the first two games in the series, but there are some new features, namely the Brothers Bear. There are 13 of these helpful bears throughout the game, including Blunder, who gives out secrets; Barter, who swaps items; Barnacle, who runs the gift shop; and Benny and Bjorn, twins who run the ski lifts on the mountains. Also new to this series are Banana Birds, which help you save your progress. As you progress through this game's many exotic tropical worlds, you (or you and a friend alternating) will control both Dixie and Kiddy Kong. Dixie's primary strengths involve her pony tail, which enables her to form a Helicopter Spin, which can be used to whip enemies or make incredibly long leaps. Kiddy's main asset is his strength: he can reveal hidden areas by breaking down doors and smashing the ground. Also, he can skim across water and power roll into bad guys. Both characters can swim, run, jump, swing, throw barrels, climb, and ride vehicles, such as Funky's hovercraft, which can be used to explore further sections of the map.To enable you to reach places high places, you can throw Dixie when controlling Kiddy. When you are Dixie, you can throw Kiddy and steer him to drop down fragile holes.Throughout this epic game, you'll find animal friends that you can ride, such as Enguarde the Swordfish, Squawks the Parrot, and Squitter the Spider. Enemies you must defeat include: the springy tailed Re-Koil; Nibbla, the hungry fish; Buzz the bee; Sneek, the sneaky rat; the coin-protecting alligator named Koin; Bristels, the rolling hedgehog; and Swoopy, the sharp-beaked bird.In Donkey Kong Country 3, as in the first two games in the series, barrels play a significant role in the action. Star Barrels act as save points, TNT Barrels explode when thrown, Bonus Barrels let you play bonus round games, and Invincibility Barrels let you gain temporary invincibility. You'll find many other kinds of barrels as you go. Treasures and items are important as well. Bananas sometimes point the way, balloons and KONG Letters give you extra lives, and coins give you bonus points, let you play Swanky's games, and help you pay for items.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Dragon Ball Z is interactive version of fight sequences in the popular anime series. This game allows players to jump way into the air and perform a variety of moves while in the air. While fighting, players can consult the radar to pinpoint the location of the opponent. Every player has a fireball and also is capable of a super move that will often kill the opponent in a single blow.The graphics in Dragon Ball Z are somewhat grainy and the detail to the characters and backgrounds leave a bit to be desired. The music is sparse, and the sound effects might be compared to an Atari 2600 game. Though, there is a lot of space to fight; the screen will even split when you get too far apart and you can attack from afar. Perhaps that most refreshing thing about this game is that it really isn't like all the others. The format is totally different than any game to date, but still falls soundly into the 2D fighter genre.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (known as Dragon Ball Z: Ultime Menace in France) is the last installment to the Super Butoden series for the SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin Buu saga. Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one available as a secret character: Future Trunks.Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can now fly up or down while on the same screen as your opponent. You can also struggle with your rival pushing with your arms together to test your button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as well.The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another player. This makes Super Butouden 3 the only game of the series without a Story Mode,. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released the Buu saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV.</gameplot>

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.</gameplot>

Choose from three playable characters, the Bogards and family friend Joe Higashi, before embarking on your revenge-filled journey through the city of South Town. Your goal is to defeat all remaining combatants standing in the way of your showdown with Geese Howard. A conversion of SNK's coin-op game, Fatal Fury for Super NES features a few notable changes. Fighting takes place on one plane instead of two, and the enemy characters can be used in versus play against a friend. There is a catch, however: only the second player can control the rival characters, as the first player is limited to fighting as Terry Bogard, Joe Higashi, or Andy Bogard.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The kingdom of Baron has undergone a significant change recently; the province has become the first in the world to create airships that make global travel a simple accomplishment, and has thus immediately established itself as one of the world's primary powers. But as the adage goes, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and as of late the king of Baron has been making moves to ensure his power will remain absolute in the years to come. To that effect, he has sent his minions out into the world, scavenging for the mysterious and potent elemental crystals for some dark and as-of-yet unrevealed end.The Red Wings are the kingdom's elite fighters, handlers of Baron's airship fleets and the most trusted of the king's subjects. At their lead is Cecil, an orphan and now the Dark Knight of Baron, by request of the king, the man who took him in. With the airships, they have looted and burned towns, killed innocent subjects of other lands, and most recently stolen the crystal of water from the helpless town of Mysidia. Cecil, like any good soldier, has been able to justify these actions under the classification of "just following orders"... until now. Even though he wears the armor and wields the sword of the Dark Knight, he is not heartless, and his actions weigh heavily on his conscience. But the king has been kind to him, so he will not abdicate his position or remove the mantle of Dark Knight that he loathes so much.This is the setup of Final Fantasy II (known as Final Fantasy IV in Japan), the first of the trio of Final Fantasy games released on Nintendo's 16-bit platform. With Final Fantasy II, Square Soft finally began establishing a name for itself in the U.S. While it resembled its 8-bit predecessor in many ways, there were plenty of new additions to the Final Fantasy world for fans on both sides of the Pacific. The storyline, hinted at above, takes plenty of twists and turns in various directions, always focusing mainly on the trials and tribulations of Cecil but branching out to include the tales of many characters. You can have up to five members in your party at one time, although unlike later entries in the Final Fantasy canon, you don't control who you have or when you have them; the whims of the story dictate that. Each character is presented at a different point in the game, and all have a goal to accomplish, adding more subtext to the overall story.The quest itself takes place on a global scale, and this particular unnamed world boasts all manner of environments, from swamps to deserts to plains, as well as a wide host of caves, castles, and other assorted dens of evil for brave adventurers to wander around, slowly building experience until they can beat the area's boss and head on to the next bit of storyline. The adventure involves dwarves, giant airships, an ancient evil, and even an excursion to the moon before all is said and done.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A world once vibrant with the power of magic has plunged into an industrial age, one that has raped the countrysides, disempowered its people, and brought tremendous conflict that has touched every corner of the globe. All the lands are now governed by a corrupt empire, headed by Emperor Gestahl, who uses powerful machines to keep the world at bay. There is also another weapon, one far more powerful than any conventional powers: a young girl named Terra whose blood is half of the mysterious creatures known as Espers, the last remnants of that magical time so long ago. They have turned her into a biological weapon with their mind-controlling slave crown.But Terra will slip free of the Empire's grasp and meet up with a young rogue named Locke, a man living with the pain of a lost love who he could not help. Together they will begin an epic journey that will stretch across the land, perhaps even bringing it to its end. But the ultimate question is whether or not the powerful Empire is really the most dangerous threat to the heroes and the world, or if somehow there is a force even more powerful, chaotic, and deadly that is pulling the puppet strings from behind the veil.So begins Final Fantasy III, known as Final Fantasy VI in Japan, the last domestic Final Fantasy to appear on the Super NES. Final Fantasy III is a role-playing game which spans the course of several years and incorporates sixteen different characters for you to play, each with his or her own back-story and plot. These episodes are introduced into the story as players achieve certain milestones.The game boasts hours of gameplay and many different locations to explore. Familiar Final Fantasy faces and items make an appearance during the course of the game, from Chocobos and Mogs to airships, masamunes, and other objects. Most of the characters have at least one different and unique skill, such as the ability to do combo power moves, emulate other animals, and capture and summon the powerful Espers hidden around the world, from Bahamut to Ragnarok.Final Fantasy III also has a magic system similar to other Final Fantasy titles, with basics such as Fire, Ice, Bio, Warp, plus a host of spells new to the franchise. It additionally features two different versions of the same world, before and after a war: The World of Balance and The World of Ruin. Final Fantasy III includes battery backup that allows players to save three different games on the same cartridge.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Final Fantasy VI is a role-playing video game. It was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as a part of the Final Fantasy series. The game was known as Final Fantasy III when it was first released in North America, as the original Final Fantasy III had not been released outside of Japan at the time. However, later localizations used the original title.Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Crime ridden, gang infested Metro City has elected a new mayor. But this mayor is not like the others that have come before. He is Mike Haggar, a former professional wrestler and street fighter. The gangs have been unable to bribe him to let them have their way in the city, so the Mad Gear gang, the most powerful of them all, has kidnapped his daughter Jessica.Now, Mike Haggar is out for revenge. He and his friend Cody (a fifth degree black belt in Karate) must fight their way through five sections of the city to rescue Jessica and rid Metro City of its gang influence.Final Fight for the Super NES is a one-player port of the 1989 Capcom coin-op game. While the arcade original has three playable characters, the Super NES version has only two, dropping Guy and keeping Cody and Mike Haggar. As either of these two fighters you must work your way through the city, using punches, kicks, jumping kicks and throws to cut a swath through the gang members in your way. In desperate situations you can employ a special attack that hits everyone around you, but at the cost of a small percentage of your health. You can uncover a variety of useful items by beating down thugs or destroying phone booths, billboards and barrels. Usable items include pizza, grapes, apples and other food that can be eaten for health, jewelry and cash that can be picked up for points, and weapons (such as knives, pipes and swords) that can be used on thugs.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>It's been one year since Metro City mayor Mike Haggar, with the help of his friends Cody and Guy, liberated the city from the clutches of the Mad Gear gang and rescued his daughter Jessica. Now Cody is off vacationing with his girlfriend Jessica, and Guy has gone back to Japan to train. But unbeknownst to Mike Haggar, the Mad Gear gang has been rebuilding itself, preparing for the day when it would not only try to take over Metro City, but the world as well. The Mad Gear gang has made its move, kidnapping Guy's fiancée Rena and her father Genryusai, also Guy's master. Rena's younger sister Maki has contacted Mike Haggar and requested help in rescuing her sister and father. Now Maki, Haggar, and Carlos Miyamoto, a lodger at Haggar's house, must fight their way through Mad Gear's territory to rescue Rena and Genryusai, and to break the gang's power.Final Fight 2 is the sequel to the 1991 Super NES single-player game Final Fight, itself an adaptation of Capcom's 1989 coin-op game. Now up to two players can go through the game cooperatively, each selecting one of the game's playable characters. Each of the characters has his or her own arsenal of moves, including punches, kicks, and throws.

The game offers a standard two-player mode as well as an innovative auto two-player mode.

There are two types of special attacks in the game. The first is an attack that hits all enemies surrounding your character, but costs a small portion of your health when used successfully. The second super attack causes a great deal of damage, but can only be used when your super gauge is full. You can increase your super gauge by attacking enemy characters.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The Super NES port of Final Fight was missing the Arcade version's two-player option, female enemies and the ability to play as Guy. In 1992, Capcom made an attempt to "fix" one of these problems with the Japanese-only Final Fight Guy, which removed Cody and replaced him with Guy. No other changes were made to the game.

To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed, including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest.The large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored. Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them, keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the park's motion detectors have been activated.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Progress is out of control in Killer Instinct for the Super NES. The game takes place in a bleak future in which a powerful corporation by the name of Ultratech produces weapons to sell to other corporations bent on destroying one another. To test these weapons, the company provides them to combatants in a popular game show called the Killer Instinct Tournament. Produced by Ultratech's entertainment division, this tournament is a bloody series of one-on-one, Mortal Kombat 3-style fights in which the winner gets anything he or she wants and the losers get to meet their maker.Fights are organized into rounds consisting of 100 seconds each. Your goal as a contestant is to eliminate the other fighter's two life bars by pummeling the fighter senseless. You can jump, duck and block, and you can thrash your opponent with punches, kicks, sweeps, uppercuts and other standard moves. Each standard move has one of three levels of intensity: quick, medium and fierce.To maximize your score, you should pull off combos and special moves whenever you can. When your opponent is near death, you can pull off a Danger Move or an Ultra Combo. Ultra Combos are sometimes in excess of 20 hits! There are 11 different aliens, mystics, undead creatures and other fighters, each endowed with numerous moves and weapons of his or her own. For example: Riptor, a hybrid of a dinosaur and a human being, can spew flaming venom, release dragon breath and execute a claw uppercut; Saberwulf, a being afflicted with lycanthropy, can release a flaming bat, pull off a sabreslap and let loose with a howl; and Cinder, a creature of living flame, has a killer heatfist, a wicked fireflash and a devastating inferno move.The manual lists 10 special moves for each fighter, but players can discover more advanced moves (such as Air Doubles, Shadow Moves and Post Breaker Specials) by experimenting with the controls. There are three basic ways to pull of special moves. Prior to pressing an attack button, you must hold a control pad button down for a couple of seconds, perform a rolling motion on the pad or tap on the pad. The last enemy you will face in this game is Eyedol, an evil warlord who was once banished from Earth. Ultratech has plucked him out of the past to do battle with the finalist in the Killer Instinct Tournament. A practice mode is available if you're not ready for the rigors of tournament play.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, King Arthur and the knights of Camelot have been encased inside glass by Morgana Le Faye. Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>King Arthur's World is a side-view puzzle game in which players must guide (using the control pad or, preferably, the Super NES mouse) an army through obstacle-laden lands (including the Goblin Underworld) in order to let the fabled king pass through. There are seven different character types (barrelmen, engineers, knights, archers, soldiers, white mages and black mages), each with different skills, such as laying bombs, bashing open doors, slashing enemies, and building climbable constructs. The characters are a little small, but the graphics are nice, and Dolby Surround Sound gives the game a commanding presence in terms of audio. Fans of Lemmings should enjoy the many strategic challenges found in this game.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>This text refers to the Arcade version of this title.In many ways reminiscent to Golden Axe or Magic Sword, The King of Dragons allows for multiple character classes and a similar style of 2D side scrolling action. The story revolves around a city and its trouble withstanding attacks from a red dragon named Gildiss. You are to develop an assault of one or two characters to find this dragon and rid your home of danger once and for all. There are five character classes to choose from and all based upon classic fantasy games. Between the Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, Elf, and Dwarf there are plenty of interesting powerup combinations and spells to keep things interesting on multiple plays. In addition, a unique gaming concept is the use of magic crystals throughout the game which must be struck by a friendly weapon in order to release their powers upon the onscreen enemies.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Sometime in the future, the world devolves into a place where monsters rule supreme. After years of wreaking having on Earth, these so-called Super Monsters ask the existential question: "Which among us is the most powerful?" After years of fighting, four rise to prominence. They are the superhero Astro Guy, whose Power Weapon is a Flash Wave; Godzilla-like Geon, who is deadly with a Flame Crusher; stone-faced Rockey, who crushes opponents with his Rockey Bomber; and slimy mutant Beetlemania, who attacks his foes with a Beetle Missile. To play this game, you choose one of these four monsters, using him to fight the rest of the monsters one at a time. In the two-player mode, you and a friend each choose a monster and fight each other. The two of you can also choose a favorite level: Megaport, Castle City, Dragon City, or Tokyo. Each level consists of two stages. While fighting a monster, you should be on the lookout for tanks, jets, battleships, and laser vehicles that will attack you from all sides. To defeat your opponent, you must weaken him and pin him down for a count of three.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>One of a virtual avalanche of Tetris-inspired puzzlers, Kirby's Avalanche has players maneuvering pairs of Blobs that fall from the top of the playfield, lining them up in groups of four or more in order to vanquish them from the screen. Boulders, which are destroyed when adjacent to an exploding Blob, clutter the playfield as well, appearing on one side of the split screen when the other player (you, a friend, or the computer) eliminates a large group of Blobs with a single pair. By general standards, Kirby's Avalanche is not at all bad. It has the typically cute Nintendo-style characters and music, plenty of challenge, solid controls, and spot-on gameplay. However, it's not as elegantly streamlined as Tetris or as exciting as Tetris Attack, and is not nearly as addicting.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Nintendo's first stab at miniature golf, Kirby's Dream Course is a highly original game that incorporates elements of billiards, action, and platforming. Kirby is the ball, and each of the 64 holes (spread over eight courses) is hidden and must be found by running into enemies. Certain enemies will release a power (such as bouncing or a backspin maneuver) to Kirby when hit. Lining up some of the harder shots and shooting for lower and lower scores requires skill and strategic thinking as players set spin, aim, power, and other factors throughout the tricky, geometrically intimidating courses. Fans of Kirby's Adventure and other Kirby games (primarily of the platform variety) will enjoy the cute, familiar characters and music, while hardcore gamers will appreciate the surprisingly high level of challenge.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The third game in the legendary Zelda series (after The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link for the NES), The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is widely regarded as one of the greatest games of all time for any console. The storyline, which involves rescuing Princess Zelda and seven other maidens (each locked in a away in a different dungeon), is engrossing, the Light and Dark Worlds (which you can teleport between using a Magic Mirror) are filled with secrets, traps and puzzles, the battle system is tight, and the interfacing and mapping system is convenient and easy to use. Link begins the game empty handed but will soon find a sword and shield and will eventually discover numerous other items, including many new to the series, such as the Pegasus Boots, the aforementioned mirror, and a grappling hook. Longtime Nintendo composer Koji Kondo (Super Mario World) provides the musical score (meaning that it's excellent, of course), and the graphics and sounds show excellent attention to detail. All in all, this is a must-own title and a wonderful return to (and upgrading of) the many things that made the original The Legend of Zelda such a brilliant success. After the somewhat disappointing (but still solid) Zelda II, this is a good (make that great) thing.</gameplot>

Thanks to the efforts of Mega Man and his friends, Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice. However, Wily had always known that he might be imprisoned one day, and so he had constructed four backup Robot Masters in a hidden laboratory, Burst Man, Cloud Man, Junk Man, and Freeze Man. If they did not receive a communication within six months, they would begin searching for their master. After six months, the robots activate and go on a rampage throughout the city in which Dr. Wily is being held. Mega Man is called into action. Upon driving into the city with Roll and Auto, he sees that the it is in ruins, and that he is too late to stop Wily's Robot Masters from liberating the evil scientist. Mega Man gives chase, but is stopped by Bass, a robot with capabilities much like Mega Man's own, and his robotic wolf Treble. After a brief skirmish, Mega Man is informed that the two of them are battling Wily as well. Bass and Treble then take off, leaving Mega Man confused, but convinced that he has new allies and determined to again stop Dr. Wily's plans.</gameplot>

Yet the core gameplay is virtually unchanged from earlier titles, with themed stages serving as home bases for colorful and quirky boss characters. Defeating each Maverick allows Mega Man X to acquire its distinctive weapon, from a boomerang blade to a whirling tornado, which can be used to improve his chances on subsequent stages. In addition to blasting foes left and right, X can climb walls and perform a high-speed dash.

According to an intelligence report by Dr. Cain, they have been detected in an abandoned production factory. Only one reploid in a special armada of mobilized Maverick Hunters was able to penetrate the heavy artillery surrounding the factory. The hero's name is Mega Man X, and his job is to destroy the leaders of this new uprising.As Mega Man X, you are equipped with a firing mechanism that shoots right and left, and you can add numerous weapons (such as bubbles, slicers and chains) to your arsenal as you progress through the game. You can also find secret capsules hidden by Dr. Light. These will enhance your abilities, giving you the power to jump higher, charge up weapons and perform other helpful feats. As if that's not enough to assist you in your battle against the Mavericks, you can at certain points in the game hop into a Mobile Attack Cycle, which can fly, and Mobile Attack Armor, which is equipped with a spin blade and enables you to become invincible. You begin the game in the abandoned reploid factory. After shooting your way out, a stage select screen will appear, giving you the whereabouts of eight different Maverick leaders. After defeating all eight levels, you will be given another set of eight. You can only escape a level after you have beaten its boss. These Maverick bosses include such unlikely characters as Bubble Crab, Magna Centipede and Wheel Gator.You are given two lives and gain new ones by collecting Mega Man icons. You can also pick up heart tanks to increase the length of your health meter and tablets to recharge your health. A password feature is available that allows you to save a game in progress.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A botched nuclear experiment sends young physicist Lester Knight Chaykin on an inter-dimensional trip to a strange new world, one ravaged by earthquakes and inhabited by hostile aliens. Alone in an unfamiliar place, Chaykin will have to use his sharp intellect and quick-thinking skills to survive the many obstacles placed in his path. In addition to a variety of action-oriented, environmental-based puzzles to solve, the game also includes some combat sequences. Chaykin can either engage in hand-to-hand battles or equip a multi-functional laser pistol. Moves are otherwise limited to jumping, ducking, and running. In development for two years, Out of This World features an atmospheric presentation with polygonal graphics brought to life with a technique called rotoscoped animation. There is no visible interface, no dialogue sequences, and the camera will zoom, scale, and pan at various points to give the action a cinematic feel.</gameplot>

You are the only one who can save her, but you've been arrested and thrown in the dank dungeons, far below the palace where the princess nervously waits in a room at the top of a tower. You escape the guards' clutches, but you have a long way to go to rescue your true love and depose the cruel tyrant who rules his land.Played in real time, Prince of Persia gives you exactly one hour of game time to master its secrets and reach your objective. You'll have to leap across bottomless chasms, avoid spikes that shoot up from the floor, and battle nasty swordsmen. Using animation modelled after the movements of real people, creator Jordan Mechner has crafted an intriguing game which not only looks wonderful, but also has the feel of an old adventure film.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Similar to the first Prince of Persia, the character explores various deadly areas by running, jumping, crawling, avoiding traps, solving puzzles and drinking magic potions. Prince of Persia 2 is, however, more combat-heavy than its predecessor. In the first game, enemies appear only occasionally and are always alone, while in the sequel, up to four enemies may appear at once, sometimes flanking the player, and may even be instantly replaced by reinforcements when they are killed. As in Prince of Persia, the trick is to complete the game under a strict time limit that passes in real time. Lives are unlimited, but time cannot be regained except by reverting to a previously saved game. In other areas, more significant improvements have been made. The graphics are far more complex than the simple look of the game's predecessor, the areas explored are larger, and the variety of backdrops is greater.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>In this translation of SNK's hit arcade game, Samurai Shodown for the Super Nintendo offers twelve selectable characters, thirteen animated stages, and multiple bonus rounds--all squeezed onto a 32-Meg cartridge. As an 18th century noble warrior, you must use your sword to battle ninjas and other Samurai from around the world. Setting this game apart from most fighters are a "Rage Gauge," which makes you stronger as you absorb damage, and a "Courier Man" who runs past the screen dropping special items such as food and money. Learn and master a variety of special moves as you fight for honor!The characters are as follows: Fugu Blade wielding Ha-Oh Maru; Samurai "heartthrob" Ukyo Tachibana; young environmentalist Nakoruru; French leader Charlotte; Ninjas Galford and Hanzo Hattori; two-handed swordsman Jubei Yagyu; former Kabuki actor Kyoshiro Senryo, military giant Wan Fu; Mayan Tam Tam; scissor-handed Genan Shiranui; and Earthquake, the massive Texan. Battle each character until you come face to face with the evil Shiro Tokisada Amakusa! Parents should be warned that Samurai Shodown carries an MA-13 rating for animated violence and blood.</gameplot>

Underwater is a dangerous place.The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing rightStinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drillSea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transportRemote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switchesDarwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach.

Players portray Fox McCloud as he pilots his Airwing fighter through both space and planetary areas, gunning down enemy ships (with lasers and nova bombs), dodging lasers, flying through narrow gaps, firing at tough bosses, and more. Your three wingmen, Slippy Toad, Falco Lombardi, and Peppy Hare, are on hand to lend a helping hand, but you must cover their backs as well. There are two hidden levels to find, power-ups to collect, and warps to discover. Gameplay is smooth, though there is some slowdown, and players can select three different pathways (easy, medium and hard), making for a title that is fun for gamers of varying skills.</gameplot>

Also, you can turn the time limit on or off. Like in the first game, a couple of energy meters across the top of the screen let you know who is winning the round. Pick one of 12 warriors, including the four bosses, and battle your way until you are the last one standing.

				<gameplot>With Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, Capcom has done a masterful job of cramming the 58 megabit arcade game into a 16-meg Super NES cartridge. The game is fast and hard-hitting with little slowdown, and a number of extras are included, such as an "all-new" Versus mode. There are missing elements, but they are relatively insignificant. Thanks to Nintendo's family-friendly policies, the blood has been changed to a gray substance (supposedly sweat) and Chun Li's moves aren't as provocative. In addition, a few background animations, character voices, and minor moves didn't make the cut. Nonetheless, this home rendition is a remarkable achievement.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Super Battleship for the Super NES brings Battleship, the classic board game, to your television screen. Your mission is to become a successful Naval commanding officer by maneuvering your fleet, repairing damages to your ships, and using weapons and strategies to destroy your enemy. The game is divided into two modes of play: Super Battleship and Classic Battleship.Classic Battleship lets you play using a screen similar to the original board game; you have an overhead view of two square grids, one for you on the left and one for the enemy on the right. After aligning your fleet of five ships on the grid, you will need to aim three shots at the enemy's grid. Then it will be the enemy's turn to fire back and so on and so on. Presumably, the computer cannot "see" the positioning of your ships on the grid, just as the enemy ships are invisible to you. Play continues until either side loses all its ships.The Super Battleship option takes place in the open seas, giving you an overhead view of the battlefield via a Battleship Command Post. This too is a turn-based contest, but many more features are available, including the ability to advance your fleet and repair your ships.

				<gameplot>This game scales back a lot of gameplay additions made in Super Bomberman 2 and returns to the classic formula. As for multiplayer, the game adds a lot over the previous game by adding more characters, each representing a country of Earth (including one of the villains, Pretty Bomber, as France, which marks her first appearance as a non-enemy character). There are also new cutscenes for the Story mode, which centers around the resurrection of the Five Dastardly Bombers who were previously defeated in Super Bomberman 2, as Shirobon and Kurobon adventure across various element themed stars in which the Five are causing havoc, under the rule of their creator, Bagular.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The evil Magikoopa Kamek has hatched a plot to kidnap the newborn Mario brothers, and his toadies are dispatched to rob the stork of this precious cargo. They succeed in capturing only Luigi, however, and the baby Mario falls to the ground. There he is found by Yoshi, who sets out on a great adventure to rescue Luigi and return the brothers to their parents.The twist in Yoshi's Island is that you control Yoshi for the majority of the game, not Mario. Baby Mario rides on Yoshi's back as you travel through six worlds (with eight stages per world) on your way to Kamek's castle. When Yoshi is hit by an enemy, Mario falls off and floats in a bubble. You then have a limited amount of time to regain Mario before the toadies capture him and you lose a life. When you grab a Super Star, Mario, whom you will control for a short time, will power-up and become an invincible little tike who can do a whole lot of damage to enemies.Crafty dinosaur that he is, Yoshi can run and jump and he can use his lashing tongue to grab enemies. He can then spit the enemy out or swallow the enemy to create an egg, which will grant you a coin, two stars or a special red coin. Yoshi can find watermelons that will enable him to spit seeds, fire, and ice at the enemies. Also, by touching a metamorphosis bubble, Yoshi will temporarily become a helicopter, a mole tank, a submarine, a train, or a car.Throughout the game there are many other items that Yoshi can use to good effect. These include objects that turn all the enemies into clouds or stars, show you where the red coins are in the stage, allow you access to hidden areas, increase the countdown timer, give you clues and much more. There are also mini battles, such as Popping Balloons and a Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest, and bonus challenges, such as Scratch and Match and The Slot Machine.Yoshi's Island was one of the last games released for the Super NES and utilizes the Super FX2 chip for enhanced graphic effects such as rotation and scaling. Battery backup allows you to save your progress for three different games.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The third installment in the series, Super Metroid for the Super NES once again puts you in the role of Samus Aran, a female bounty hunter. Your mortal enemies are the Metroids, which are quick to reproduce and can engulf living creatures and absorb their energy.In the first game, Metroid for the NES, Galactic Federation researchers discovered a new form of airborne life on planet SR388. They dubbed these dangerous jellyfish-like creatures Metroids and captured a few for later study. Unfortunately, as the crew sped toward Galactic Federation Headquarters, space pirates attacked the vessel, stole the Metroids and took them to their home planet, Zebes. Soon the Mother Brain created an evil Metroid force. Samus's job was to eliminate the space pirates and destroy the Metroids.In the sequel, Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Game Boy, Samus was sent to planet SR388 to make the Metroids extinct once and for all. Her final battle was against the Metroid Queen.According to Super Metroid lore, after destroying the queen, Samus discovered a Metroid egg, which she procured and took with her to the Space Science Academy on the Galactic Federation Space Colony. Here scientists could examine the Metroid larva and understand its special organic structure. Naturally, those pesky Zebesian space pirates and their leader, Ridley, stole the larva and too it back to their rebuilt home planet. Samus promptly received an emergency directive from the Federation, ordering her to follow the pirates and save the hatchling. When she lands on Zebes, she finds that she must now take on an entire legion of space pirates as well as a new Metroid force.The planet Zebes is made up of six huge sections: the surface area, which is under a constant deluge of rain, is called Crateria; Brinstar is a jungle area with a heavy maze of foliage; an underground water world called Maridia is full of killer crustaceans and ferocious fish; deep below the surface of the planet lies the unbearably hot Norfair; the remains of an astronaut crash comprises the Wrecked Ship; and Tourian is the control center for the space pirates and Mother Brain. Throughout the game, you must break down color-coded doorways that were designed to prevent intruders from roaming into restricted areas.As you run, jump, spin, roll and shoot your way through twisted, threatening passageways of this game, you can fire upon Chozo Statues, which will reveal special items that will help you in your mission. You can collect missile tanks, power bombs, a grappling beam (which enables you to swing into certain areas), an x-ray scope (which allows you to see hidden passages) and energy tanks. When you destroy enemy creatures, they sometimes leave behind missiles and energy balls. At the beginning of Super Metroid, Samus is equipped with a normal beam. You can increase her power by collecting the following enhanced beams: Ice, which freezes enemies for a short time; Wave, which sends out a charge in a wavy pattern; Spazer, which is a three-beam attack; and Plasma, the most powerful beam of all. Two special suits of armor, the Varia Suit and the Gravity Suit, are available for use. The former suit cuts damage from enemy attacks in half and allows you to explore in high-temperature areas while the latter reduces damage from attacks to one fourth and lets you explore freely in water-filled zones.Special boot items you can find will help you reach higher places, jump continuously, fly through open areas and run at super high speed while invincible. Superpowers you can acquire for use in turning yourself into a living weapon include: morphing ball, bomb, spring ball and screw attack. The screw attack enables you to somersault into enemies and blast them into oblivion.In addition to battling space pirates, you must face a barrage of freakish creatures and numerous traps. You'll ward off clawed Geruta, fireball-spitting dragons, cacti needle-launching Cacatac, thorny bullet-firing Evir and any number of other creepy, crawly critters. Also, each level has a boss and mini-boss that you must defeat.Super Metroid is a 24 Meg cartridge, and it includes a battery for saving your progress after you turn off your Super NES. A mapping system is available to help you track your mission. There are several endings to the game, depending on how much time you spend trying to beat the game. A shorter time results in a more spectacular finale.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The final chapter of the original Star Wars trilogy comes to life in Star Wars: Super Return of the Jedi. Join Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Princess Leia (in both her Boushh bounty hunter costume and bikini), Han Solo, and even Wicket the Ewok as you battle through 20 stages of space rebellion. Before most stages, you are able to choose between two or more of these characters to accomplish the mission at hand. As Luke, you can use certain Force abilities. Your standard side-to-side platform format composes most of the game, but the view changes to a more straight-ahead 3D perspective when you're piloting one of the game's vehicles, which include a landspeeder, a speeder bike, and the Millennium Falcon. As in the movie, you'll progress through such exotic locations as Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, the Ewok village on Endor, and the second Death Star. After you have defeated the Imperial forces on Endor and bested Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine with Luke, you still have one thing to do -- destroy the Death Star and get out!</gameplot>

				<gameplot>The sequel to Super Star Wars, Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back has fuzzier visuals than the original game, but the score, the voice effects, the graphics, and the action scenarios are superbly faithful to the film. Gameplay involves riding a Taun-Taun through a blizzard on Hoth, piloting a snowspeeder while battling AT-AT walkers, battling Boba Fett in Cloud City, facing Darth Vader in the Reactor, and much more. Once again, depending on the level, players control Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Chewbacca, and once again there's a lot of running, jumping, shooting, and lightsabering. However, this time, thanks to a user-friendly password feature, there's far less frustration involved in trying to beat the game. Speaking of frustration, there are a number of blind jumps and cheap hits (from off screen enemies), but this doesn't spoil the overall greatness of the game.</gameplot>

For those unfamiliar with either game, Tetris involves moving one of seven different tetrads down a well. For every horizontal row you complete, a line will disappear giving you points and buying you some time as the pieces keep falling.Dr. Mario has players moving falling pill capsules to wipe out different colored viruses positioned somewhere within a well. Once you match three colors together (either horizontally or vertically), the virus disappears. Remove all of the viruses and play resumes on a faster, more difficult level. Want to compete against a friend, but can't agree on which game to play? One player can play Tetris on one side while the second plays Dr. Mario on the other! You can then see who's better in a three-round timed challenge. Solo players need not worry -- there are three different computer opponents to face.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a colored block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching colors by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line).Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.Tetris Attack provides several single-player modes. Story Mode takes the player through the game's main plot, pitting the player against a series of foes in a head-to-head match. The objective is to cause the computer-controlled player to lose. In Endless Mode, the player is challenged to play as long as possible with a continuously rising stack of blocks, which increases in speed over time. Timed Mode challenges the player to score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit, and Stage Clear mode takes the player through a series of stages in which the objective is to clear blocks below a set line. A Puzzle Mode is also provided, which presents the player with a number of puzzles where he or she must clear all of the blocks in a set number of moves (Blocks do not rise in this mode).In addition to the game's single-player modes, Tetris Attack also provides several multiplayer modes that are essentially two-player variants of the single-player modes. One or both human players may be substituted with a computer-controlled player with a selectable difficulty level.</gameplot>

Game controls are simple: B Button makes Jerry/Tuffy to jump (tapping it again lightly upon landing will activate their Super Jumps), while A/Y/X Buttons will make them to throw marbles upward (Y Button) and downward (X/Y Buttons) in the enemies.To earn extra lives throughout the game, players have two available options: the rarest and, sometimes, hardest way is to find a 1-Up icon; however, the easiest mode is to collect 100 of small balls of cheese scattered throughout the levels (Cheese Bits). Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges (Cheese Chunks). At the end of each world, Jerry and Tuffy will take a confrontation with Tom, the Cat.</gameplot>

The game has a split-screen display for 1 or 2 players. In 1-Player mode, you'll dispute the races against the computer, that has a slightly bigger speed than yours, helping to give a lot more of competitiveness. A password system was included, being possible to stop a current game and resume it later.Through the game, players will find several obstacles scattered by the courses, like rows of iron plates or even lots of stones. In order to qualify for the next circuit, it's required to complete it at least in the 5th position, or else the game is over.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</gameplot>

Evil media mogul H.R. Malone plans to overthrow the U.S. Government. The Strike C.O.R.E. has learned of the plot and needs you to disable all of his military operations. The game features over forty missions spanning ten levels in key U.S. cities, such as New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Three new vehicles are at your disposal, including the Mohican and Blackhawke assault choppers and Ground Assault Vehicle (GAV). For the first time in a Strike game, you can now journey on foot for certain missions (many of which are timed!) in your campaign to defeat H.R. Malone.As in previous games in the Strike series, the emphasis is on action as you fly into well-defended combat zones. Nearly everything can be destroyed, which is important since many buildings contain extra fuel, armor and ammo to help you reach your objectives. Cinematic cut-scenes will help explain the story after each level and a map screen will help you plan out your mission in detail.</gameplot>

A two-player simultaneous mode (à la Shadow of the Ninja), nifty (if limited) voice effects, tons of targets, colorful sprites, detailed backgrounds, and a genre-specific soundtrack add to the fun. The control pad moves the character and the targeting cursor in unison, making aiming while avoiding enemy fire a little tricky at times, but gameplay is nonetheless a hoot.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Wing Commander, released in 1990 by Origin Systems, is a simulation style action game interwoven with a cinematic storyline set in the 27th century.In the first scenario, the player takes the role of a young Lieutenant who has just been assigned to the carrier ship Tiger's Claw, the pride of the Confederate Navy. As the primary goal of the game unfolds, you learn of the Confederation's campaign to take Vega Sector from the Kilrathi.What made this game so popular was that it didn't attempt to model real-world physics with a completely accurate simulation of space flight, but concentrated instead on providing a fun, intense, first-person space dogfighting experience. Several things distinguished it from other games upon its initial release: the graphics, music, and sound were all revolutionary, surpassing most (if not all) other competing products in the industry at the time. The storyline, of which a short segment unraveled after each mission the player flew, had many plot devices rarely used before in a computer game of its type: character development, interpersonal conflict, ethics, and more</gameplot>

There are bombing missions where you have to take out targets that were circled in an aerial photograph, strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: dogfights in the sky.If a mission is completed successfully, the player can power up the successful pilot in four skill categories: flying, shooting, mechanics, and stamina. A failed mission can lead to either a dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Because of a rise of anti-mutant activity in Genosha, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the island nation and discovers Apocalypse's presence there. Genosha's government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.Each character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.While most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>Yoshi's Cookie is a fast-paced puzzle game that can be enjoyed by everyone as it is easy to play, but challenging to complete. To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</gameplot>

				<gameplot>A radical departure from Super Mario World (which featured the first appearance of Yoshi), Yoshi's Safari is a Super Scope 6 game viewed from a Super Mario Kart-like perspective. Perched aboard the delightful dinosaur, players aim the gargantuan gun at the screen, firing away at Koopa, Bowser and other Mario enemies. If Yoshi is hit with friendly fire, he will turn around and give the player a dirty look, exemplifying the cute, kid-friendly nature of this game. The action is linear, the game is short and easy to beat, and the background music is delightful, further defining this as a juvenile title. The pseudo 3D graphics are very impressive (the game looks even better than the "real" Mario games), but the shooting sounds can get annoying. The best thing about the game is a special two-player mode, which lets one gamer guide Yoshi (who runs and jump over gaps) while the other player uses the Scope.</gameplot>
